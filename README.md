# COMP204_Fall2019
 COMP 204 Fall 2020: Computer programming for Life Sciences (3 Credits)
Course Description
Computer programming in a high level language: variables, expressions, types, functions, conditionals, loops, objects and classes. Introduction to algorithms, modular software design, libraries, file input/output, debugging. Emphasis on applications in the life sciences.
Prerequisites: BIOL 112 and a CEGEP level mathematics course

Restrictions: Only one of COMP 204, COMP 202 and COMP 208 can be taken for credit. COMP 204 cannot be taken for credit with or after COMP 250, COMP 206, COMP 208, or COMP 364.

This course introduces students to computer programming and is intended for those with little or no background in the subject. No knowledge of computer science in general is necessary or expected. On the other hand, basic computer skills such as browsing the Web, sending e-mail, creating documents with a word processor, and other such fundamental tasks will be necessary in this course.

Course content: The course aims to introduce students to computer programming. It uses the Python programming language. A large part of this course will focus on the basic building blocks of programming, which provide the foundations to learning other languages such as Java or C++.

Learning how to program is not easy; it is not a set of facts that one can simply memorize. In principle, a computer program is simply a set of instructions that tells a computer to perform a task. However, finding the right set of instructions can be quite challenging. For that, one has to learn how to structure a larger problem into small subsets, and then find the solution to each particular subset. This course aims to teach students a way of thinking that will enable them to build non-trivial programs.

Objectives: By the end of this course, students will be able to:
				Design and describe precise, unambiguous instructions that can be used [by a computer] to solve a problem or perform a task;
    Translate these instructions into a language that a computer can understand (Python);
    Write programs that solve complex problems (especially those arising in Life Sciences) by decomposing them into simpler subproblems;
    Apply programming-style and structure conventions to make your programs easy to understand, debug and modify;
    Learn independently about new programming-language features and libraries by reading documentation and by experimenting.

Programming language: Python 3.8
